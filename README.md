# KFoundation: JVM/JS Edition

KFoundation is a library of essentials for modern programming needs. 
It is designed based on the concept of universality, both in 
technological and geographical senses. It is available on most platforms; it 
has a very small footprint with no dependency on third-party libraries, and it is 
highly optimized for CPU and memory usage so that it works smoothly on small 
devices. It natively supports UTF-8 (as opposed to the host platform's string 
format), and comes with a  rich internationalization toolset.

This repository contains the JVM/JS edition. The main code is written in Scala,
which is cross-compiled for JVM and JS, and wrapped inside friendly native 
Java and JS APIs for the convenience of the users of those languages. 

The JVM/JS edition contains the following technologies:
* Universal UI
* Universal Serialization
* Universal Culture
* LoTeX

The native [C++ edition](https://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation) 
is more extensive as it completely replaces (and does not depend on) C and C++ 
standard libraries.
